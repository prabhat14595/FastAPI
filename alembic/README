# Alembic

Alembic is a lightweight database migration tool for usage with SQLAlchemy. It is used to manage database schema changes in a consistent and version-controlled manner.

## Key Features of Alembic
- Version control for database schemas.
- Handles upgrades and downgrades of database schemas.
- Integrates seamlessly with SQLAlchemy.

## How Alembic Works
Alembic uses migration scripts to define changes to the database schema. These scripts can be auto-generated or manually created. Each migration script contains two main functions:
- `upgrade()`: Defines the changes to apply to the database schema.
- `downgrade()`: Defines how to revert the changes.

## Common Alembic Commands
1. **Initialize Alembic**:
    ```bash
    alembic init alembic
    ```
    This creates the Alembic directory structure.

2. **Generate a New Migration**:
    ```bash
    alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Migration message"
    ```
    This generates a new migration script based on changes detected in the SQLAlchemy models.

3. **Apply Migrations**:
    ```bash
    alembic upgrade head
    ```
    This applies all unapplied migrations to the database.

4. **Revert Migrations**:
    ```bash
    alembic downgrade -1
    ```
    This reverts the last applied migration.

5. **Check Current Migration Version**:
    ```bash
    alembic current
    ```
    Displays the current migration version in the database.

## Directory Structure
After initializing Alembic, the directory structure looks like this:
